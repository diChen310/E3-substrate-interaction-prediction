# E3-substrate-interaction-prediction
Predict the interactions between E3 and substrate
We designed multi-dimensional association features to describe the correlation pattern of the E3-substrate interactions, and an ensemble prediction 
model which contains classifiers trained based on different types of negative cases was constructed.

For calculating the multi-dimensional association features you also need to prepare the TCGA RNA-seq data, BioGrid PPI network as well as KEGG pathway 
information at first.
